<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
  By trade I'm a Technical Support Analyst and Computer Consultant, but 
  the creativity is a real vocation.
  So I'm leaving my comfort zone, built over more than twenty years of
  working in the IT consulting field, to start a new career as a Web developer.
</p>

<p>
  It probably won't be a path without obstacles but hard work doesn't scare me,
  I've always enjoyed learning new skills and now I'm learning and deepening
  my knowledge in Html, CSS, JavaScript and so on, to get the necessary
  skills for my career switch.
